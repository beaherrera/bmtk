| The Allen Institute Modeling Software Workshop provides a hands-on opportunity to learn how to use open-source modeling tools 
| developed in part at the Allen Institute MindScope Program. 
|


Topics covered include:
- Construction of heterogeneous models of brain circuits at a variety of resolutions
- Simple control and modification of simulation conditions 
- Use of realistic spiking or visual inputs
- Storage of model networks, inputs and outputs in a single shareable format
- Creation of beautiful visualizations for model verification, display and analysis
